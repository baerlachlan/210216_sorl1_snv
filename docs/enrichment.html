<h1>Reproducibility of this analysis</h1>
<p>Please note that newer versions of <code>babelgene</code> and
potentially <code>msigdbr</code> cause issues with the reproducibility
of this document. The issues lies within the <code>babelgene</code>
package (a dependency of <code>msigdbr</code>), which pulls the mappings
of zebrafish orthologs to human genes, as required for the construction
of gene sets. Unfortunately the <code>msigdbr()</code> function does not
possess arguments to control this behaviour in a reproducible manner,
and therefore the package version dictates the output of the function.
To successfully reproduce this analysis the user’s system must have
<code>babelgene v22.3</code> installed, and also potentially
<code>misgdbr v7.4.1</code> (analysis successfully reproduced with this
version but not tested with newer versions i.e. 7.5.1). This document
was rendered using a docker container with the required package versions
installed (see Session information below for a complete list of
packages). Packages were installed using the
<code>R/docker-setup.R</code> script on a fresh container spun up from
the <code>bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:RELEASE_3_16</code>
image.</p>
